#### What is WDI?

The Workforce Data Initiative is a partnership launched by the Obama White House in 2015 as a partnership between public and private sector workforce data to facilitate standards, structure, and open access point for data underlying training, skills, jobs, and wages.

+++

#### What is WDI?

Work in WDI has been divided into two groups:

- *Open Skills Project* - Create a dynamic, open, common, locally relevant language for skills using public and private data.
- *Workforce Training Provider Scorecards* - Improve available information on education and training outcomes.

DSaPP has done some development work on the Training Provider side (Training Provider Outcomes Toolkit) but has focused recently on the Open Skills Project.

# What is the Research Hub?

#### What is the Research Hub?

The Open Skills Research Hub is a *collection of publicly available generated datasets* produced by the Open Skills Project from a pool of *public and private administrative data sources*, particularly job postings, for the purpose of *collaborative research*.

+++

#### What is the Research Hub?

The Research Hub is aimed primarily at the research community (e.g. labor economists, NLP researchers), rather than software developers. Thus, the deliverable is primarily tabular datasets.

One stated goal for the tabular datasets is for researchers not within the core development team at DSaPP to be able to publish whitepapers based on the data. At present, there are two public whitepapers that use Research Hub data.
