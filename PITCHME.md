#### What is the Research Hub?

The Research Hub is aimed primarily at the research community (e.g. labor economists, NLP researchers), rather than software developers. Thus, the deliverable is primarily tabular datasets.

One stated goal for the tabular datasets is for researchers not within the core development team at DSaPP to be able to publish whitepapers based on the data. At present, there are two public whitepapers that use Research Hub data
